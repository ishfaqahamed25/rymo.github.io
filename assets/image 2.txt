name - The Best Baba Ganoush Recipe


 des -

the first time I had a taste of truly excellent excellent baba ganoush—the Middle Eastern dip of roasted eggplant mixed with olive oil, sesame tahini, garlic, and lemon juice—it was made by a good friend of mine, an Israeli line cook who'd take time out of her afternoon to hover over the eggplants as they slowly charred over the open flames of the kitchen's burners. She'd wait until they were meltingly tender before recruiting me to carefully peel them, and then she'd mix them up with lemon juice, tahini, garlic, and olive oil. The resulting dip was simultaneously smoky, savory, bright, and creamy.


Could I say it was the best thing I'd ever had? No. Could I even say it was the best baba ganoush I could have imagined? Uh-uh. But what I had in that first bite was the promise of greatness, and I've been seeking that greatness ever since.


Like many great dishes, baba ganoush is extraordinarily simple in concept: Roast some eggplants; scrape out the flesh; mix it with some garlic, lemon, tahini, and olive oil; and serve. It's in the details where things get a little more complicated.
