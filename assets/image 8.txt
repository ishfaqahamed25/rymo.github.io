PS5 Stock: When and Where to Buy PlayStation 5 in August 2021


Which shops have PS5 stock for August 2021? Where can you currently buy a new PlayStation 5 console? Demand for the PS5 has exceeded supply, leaving many unable to purchase a next-gen console. Sony has suggested that it will be making more units in 2021, having secured additional component inventory from some of its key manufacturing partners. However, it's warned that there's no quick fix to the current stock situation, due to an overall shortage in semiconductors.

Nevertheless, as part of our PS5 guide, we're going to explain which stores have PS5s in stock right now, when you can expect new supply to become available, and what times those product pages will go live. Please keep in mind that stores have been quite random with stock availability, although we're endeavouring to ensure this page is accurate as possible.
