name - The 2023 Nissan Z Sports Car Is Here—and, Damn, It Looks Good


des - The Nissan Z is one of the most iconic sports cars in history. It’s back—and looks sensational. While we haven’t had a chance to test drive the new 2023 Nissan Z yet, we already know it’s better than the outgoing 370Z by a mile. How come? Here are three key reasons—and one major question mark.



Walk around the 2023 Z, and you see cues carried forward from the original 1970’s 240Z—and even from the mid-1990’s version, too. The nose features an open, but not “snarling” grille, that’s intricate and beautiful up close, as well as muscular, blistered fenders to accommodate 18- or 19-inch wheels shod with extra-fat P255/40R19 front tires and P275/35R19 rears.


Those wheels nest closely beneath the body, so the new Z looks wider (even though it’s exactly the same width as the outgoing car), in part because the body is actually stretched five inches longer. So from the side your eye interprets that length as a sleeker shape. It’s a clever trick, as is a very thin-seeming roof—that looks even thinner when you order the car with a black roof, regardless of the color of the rest of the body.
