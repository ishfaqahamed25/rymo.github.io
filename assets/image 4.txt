Coffee Basics: What is Dalgona Coffee?


Dalgona Coffee (also known as Whipped Coffee or Desi Cappuccino) is a coffee preparation made from whipped, sweetened instant coffee beat into a thick foam. The drink was the subject of a viral internet challenge in early 2020. The name “Dalgona”, under which it is most popularly known, comes from the Korean “달구나”, which translates roughly to “it's sweet”, and is also the name used for a honeycomb toffee snack sold by street vendors in Korea, which the sweet foam of the drink is said to recall.


While the sweet street-snack Dalgona originated in Busan in the 1960s, the spike in the coffee drink's popularity is often credited to Korean actor Jung Il-woo, who consumed the drink during a mukbang in Macau on a television program called “Stars' Top Recipe at Fun-Staurant.”

As they say—it's all in the wrist. Dalgona Coffee is made by mixing instant coffee (that's right, instant) with equal parts sugar and water—2 Tbsp is a good quantity of each. Whip the water, coffee, and sugar together using a whisk or hand mixer for 5-10 minutes until the mixture forms a thick, foamy froth, then serve in a layer over ice and milk. The drink will have a nice creamy head, and mix with the milk as you drink it.
